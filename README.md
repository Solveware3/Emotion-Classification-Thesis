# Emotion-Classification-Thesis 
## Introduction
Emotions in text, particularly in tweets related to the 2024 elections, reflect the public's feelings about specific issues or candidates. This project focuses on classifying five primary emotions: 
- anger 😡
- sadness 😢
- joy ☺️
- love 🥰
- fear 😱
  
Analyzing these emotions is crucial for understanding collective public sentiment, identifying sensitive issues, and providing valuable insights to support data-driven decision-making.
