happy,"Heads Up - Warpaint (2016) Well, this band by Miss T is also no less cool. Even though the songs are more pop and more 'mainstream' than the previous ones, it doesn't make the coolness of these Miss T fade. W really likes So Good, Whiteout, and The Stall [URL]"
sadness,"It's also nice to travel to high altitudes in Jakarta.. You can clearly see how polluted this city is... @ Jakarta, Indonesia [URL]"
happy,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] Wait a minute, man. I'll laugh first. Hahahahaha This is a local earthquake, man, so the potential for a tsunami is also a local tsunami. No need to worry."
love,A girl is talkative because she cares. A girl is jealous because she loves. A girl is worried because she is afraid of losing. I am grateful to have a girl like that. :)
anger,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] These guys are the ones who are actually dividing the Republic of Indonesia, why isn't BPIP taking action?"
sadness,"My left eye always has problems, whether it's a stye or pain from a lump on the edge of my temple that's been there since I was little (I've had lumps on the right and left). But it feels....a bit torturous when I need it for hard work."
sadness,"That is the importance of code of ethics material being taught since elementary school, or at least basic knowledge to do good, polite, orderly. If not, it will end up like that, not sensitive to the situation. I forgot what BK, or PKn or SosUm discussed, yes there was something like that but not specifically, so it didn't hit home."
anger,how do you change instagram story viewers? how come toxic people can be in first place -_- even though I've never opened their ig -_-
anger,"Until the 80s era was known as the Shy Nation, in the 90s the ""SHAMELESS"" virus emerged and developed until now towards becoming a Shameful Nation, Caught for Crime but instead posing as a Celebrity in front of the Camera. BPIP should be able to eradicate this Virus, have you felt the results of BPIP's work??"
sadness,This is the first time I've seen a bed and blanket and not been tempted. I'd be more tempted to lie on the floor while fanning myself. Maybe Majalaya is a different continent from Bandung :(
sadness,"You know, I'm the weakest when dealing with Nadia. It's a shame I can't refuse that little girl's wishes. Nadia, I'm gonna miss you so badly."
fear,"Life is an adventure full of mystery, that is why all humans have fear, anxiety and worry when living it, only with Jesus all fears disappear."
sadness,I didn't hate the rain that afternoon. I was just disappointed that it left when the sun was shining. Gone. Like my story and yours~ #stillaboutJune #Kaa'sstory
happy,Thank you for your wishes guys.. Some of them Alhamdulillah have come true..(Thank You Ya Allah) . . . . #throwback #nadyaandriwedding
anger,"Why does it seem like Via Vallen vs Persija? This is Women vs Sexual Harassment. Don't make it seem like Persija supports sexual harassment. Simic is indeed reckless and deserves punishment, but I'm sure his football career won't be disturbed. Uno is still the Deputy Governor, right?"
happy,"Wow, the song is really good!!! Especially when watching the live and the fanchant. It gives me goosebumps. Basically, this album is really pleasing to the ears, it will be a shame if you get the album"
anger,[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] One of the leaders in West Kalimantan who often makes slander and provokes the public and often makes misleading statements but has never received action from the authorities...
sadness,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] Yes. Because the effects after speaking up are varied, and more people are falling for what I see now and that is actually eroding the mentality even more. Maybe those who say that speaking up is exaggerating, etc., their mentality is mentally weak."
happy,"(4) and very grateful because we met with the program partners organized by LAZ YMM FI, namely the Quran memorization quarantine, a pleasant iftar and sahur atmosphere and certainly exciting stories during the quarantine and radio program. Let us be grateful for what we have now."
anger,"You said it would be a shame if [USERNAME]'s development is not continued, do you think the next president will not develop it? Why don't you say it would be a shame if Jokowi's mounting debts are not continued until this country goes bankrupt??? Congratulations on becoming a cebi, the condition is that your brain is not used"
anger,[USERNAME] Why is it always like this when registering a sailor account? The data has been filled in correctly. I've changed my email several times. Please enlighten me [URL]
happy,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] Alhamdulillah, Indonesia belongs to Allah.. we are the same.. hopefully by Allah's grace we will both be longed for in heaven. Only Allah, the One who knows the contents of the heart and gives guidance to those who always believe in Him."
