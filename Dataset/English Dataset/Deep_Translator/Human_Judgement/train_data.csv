sadness,inayah_k yes yes ' no need to be sad like that
anger,"We should appreciate that finally someone is speaking out in public like this. When many other girls are experiencing the same thing but they choose to stay silent and afraid (girls.. I feel you). We have to be as brave as Via Vallen or maybe more, so that 'they' don't get worse. :))"

anger,"Life style Lifestyle changes, especially eating patterns, which are relaxed, kill without realizing it. The ridiculous thing is that the majority do not care. Later when they get sick, they are desperate to blame genetics or factor X [URL]"
sadness,"[USERNAME] Hopefully it's true. Because it's a shame that the dignity of a Habib has to be maintained. It's a shame that many of his followers are willing to come just to defend their leader. Moreover, it's said that he wants to become a PRESIDENTIAL candidate who must be mentally prepared because it's impossible to win."
anger,"[USERNAME] [USERNAME] [USERNAME] And moreover speaking up is said to be over the top, seeking sensation, etc. They don't think, if you want to speak up, you need courage, because actually harassment is a disgrace, but if you don't speak up, people won't be deterred, they won't feel embarrassed."

Wanting to become an artist but parents want their child to become an engineer. Don't you envy people who are given wide open opportunities but don't take advantage of them?"
anger,"You insulting him is the same as letting sexual harassment run rampant. Stupid. Being harassed and then being told to be angry, reject, and curse, it doesn't work for the perpetrator of sexual harassment. What Via Vallen did affected Simic's career? Well, that's the risk, Simic, stupid."
