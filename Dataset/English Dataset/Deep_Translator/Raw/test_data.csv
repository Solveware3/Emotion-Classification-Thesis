sadness,"like a frog in a well, excessive trust in the hegemony of science and technology as a solution to various problems in Indonesia, is also a dogma of the principle of Google 'scientism' principle of Google 'arrogance of ITB alumni' eh"

happy,"in the puja mandala area, bali, we can see five worship buildings in a row, starting from a mosque, a catholic church, a monastery, a protestant christian church, and a temple. 5 religions at once, proof that this place deserves to be crowned as an icon of indonesian tolerance [url]"
